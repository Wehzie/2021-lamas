# Explanation

This source code exists because we initially developed a completely synchronous version of the game that was a command line application.
This type of application works well to run a large number of experiments for a Multi-Agent System.

Since this form of our application was not event driven, it didn't lend itself well to create an interactive web application.

Therefore we freeze the code in it's non-interactive state here.
